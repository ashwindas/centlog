				Above, you find an example of a beautiful advanced background image slideshow, recreated after the effect as seen on the website from <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/" title="Visit Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. It features changing text and playback controls. When the animation doesn\'t seem smooth, the images might not be loaded. This script can perfectly be combined with an image preloading plugin to get rid of this effect.
			</p>
			<p>
				This technique heavily relies on <a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery">jQuery</a> combined with CSS. Transparent PNG\'s are used to create the see-through effect in the menu and text background.
			</p>
			<p>
				Don\'t forget to read the article to see how it works and download the source code. Tested and works on Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera.

				Above, you find an example of a beautiful advanced background image slideshow, recreated after the effect as seen on the website from <a href="http://www.visitphilly.com/" title="Visit Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. It features changing text and playback controls. When the animation doesn\'t seem smooth, the images might not be loaded. This script can perfectly be combined with an image preloading plugin to get rid of this effect.
			</p>
			<p>
				This technique heavily relies on <a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery">jQuery</a> combined with CSS. Transparent PNG\'s are used to create the see-through effect in the menu and text background.

			<p>
				Don\'t forget to read the article to see how it works and download the source code. Tested and works on Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera.
